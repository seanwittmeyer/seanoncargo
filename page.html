<div class="content_half">I'm Sean and I am an architecture aficionado and curious person whose passion is design. From the spaces we live in to the way information is presented online, I strive to improve peoples’ interactions with their digital and physical environments. My favorite candies are Smarties (the ones from Europe), and I spend my time designing, coding, taking pictures, skiing and sailing.

I work with my friends at Zilifone as a creative multimedia designer. Feel free to view my resume and architectural portfolio to see work I've done. The printed portfolio is available upon request.
